I was just looking to make some extra money. But my world came crashing down in 2022 when the pandemic hit, and my store was shut down due to shipping delays. I was broke, and I didn’t have many options. New pathI started making low-cost products, just to get back on my feet paying my debt. That’s when I stumbled upon the idea of custom products, specifically diamond paintings. I didn’t know much about them, but I knew they could make me some money. The pressure was on, and I was working crazyly to build my new business, but I didn’t feel like I was making a difference. Turning pointThat all changed when one of my customers sent me a thank-you letter. She said spent two days making a diamond painting for her grandmother and her grandmother loved it. And she had seen my coupon but it was offline that time, she hoped to have it to afford to buy another one. I didn’t know if it was true or not, but I decided to give an extra coupon anyway.Few weeks she even sent me a photo of her grandmother, the grey hairs looked very bad but I could feel her happiness, I know she is old. Seeing that photo, I felt a rush of emotions. I thought of my own grandmother, who I ignored always. I realized that I am selling personalized products wasn’t just about making money; it was about making a difference in people’s lives. That’s why I started this blog. I want to remind everyone that love is precious. It’s hard to say, diamond painting is a best choice for gifts, but the time you will spend on it express the valueless to the meaning beyond it’s self.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Thanks for being here!","slug":"thanks for being here","date":"2022-09-11T15:08:18.000Z","updated":"2023-07-12T09:53:25.224Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/09/11/thanks for being here/","link":"","permalink":"https://dr-custom.com/2022/09/11/thanks%20for%20being%20here/","excerpt":"","text":"We’re passionate about creating unique and enchanting pieces to enhance your home decor.
